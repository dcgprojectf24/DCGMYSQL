    <p>
      Welcome to the Hawaiian and Pacific Collection Database Project! Our team, the Database Consulting Group (DCG), is dedicated to creating a cutting-edge database management system for Hamilton Library at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The Hawaiian and Pacific Collection at Hamilton Library is a vital resource for researchers, students, and community members. Our project aims to modernize its data management system, transitioning from Excel spreadsheets to a robust and scalable database. This new system will streamline cataloging, improve accessibility, and support advanced reporting to better serve the library's diverse user base.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web-Based Interface:</strong> Easy-to-use, intuitive design accessible via the web.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Search:</strong> Advanced filters for author, title, location, and publication year.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Seamlessly migrate existing Excel-based records into a unified database.</li>
      <li><strong>Geographic Data Insights:</strong> Analyze records by colonial and indigenous languages, as well as regional concentrations.</li>
      <li><strong>User Roles:</strong> Secure login and role-based access for librarians and authorized users.</li>
      <li><strong>Reports:</strong> Generate detailed inventory and usage reports for informed decision-making.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      We follow the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology, emphasizing speed, flexibility, and stakeholder involvement. This iterative approach ensures the final system reflects the needs of its users, incorporating feedback at every stage of development. From initial requirements analysis to performance evaluation, our process is designed to deliver a high-quality solution efficiently.
    </p>
